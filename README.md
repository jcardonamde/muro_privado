# muro_privado
This application is developed in python with the framework Flask. The application allows you to create comments between users and generate a type of social network flow. It was deployed on Linux Ubuntu 20.04 TLS using the EC2 service on AWS with mysql database engine, nginx web server and wsgi for python.

I use the CRUD model, where the concepts of MVC, OOP, value interpolation, modularization, and two one-to-many relationships are applied to the database. Bootstrap 5, HTML5 and CSS was used in the frontend. Python was used in the backend. The ERD model was created with MySQL Workbench. Visit: http://54.90.64.146/
